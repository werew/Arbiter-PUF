Covert Channels (Erik) #2 - Detect covert channels

The traces are online

You find your trace in your group page in the files section.

In this assignment, you will receive multiple pcap captures. You have to
decide which of them are from modified Android apps with a covert
channel and which one of them are from the unmodified app.

Part 1

You receive 10 captures, 5 of them are from the unmodified app and 5 of
them are from modified apps. You will have to say which one of them
belongs to which category. You wil get:

    5 points when you classify all of them correctly
    4 points when you do a single mistake
    3 points when you do 2 mistakes
    2 points when you do 3 mistakes
    1 point when you do 4 mistakes
    0 points otherwhise

Part 2

Also, your app will be evaluated. You get 5*x points, and x is the
percentage of how often your app was misclassified as an app without a
covert channel.

Sniffing Setup

The following setup will be used to create the captures:

The app is deployed on an Android One phone (Xiaomi A1) running Android
8.0. The phone will be connected to a WiFi network and in the same
network (connected via cable) will be a Linux system (probably Ubuntu
18.04) running Docker and the server. There will be no firewalling
between the two devices. When you would like to get a very similar
environment in Android Studio, pick a recent phone such as the Pixel 2
and select an Android Oreo 8.0 system image.
