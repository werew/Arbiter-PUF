Covert Channels (Erik) #3 (Bonus) - Ultrasonic covert channel

In this assignment, you are supposed to implement an ultrasonic covert
channel. You will again modify the Android App from the first
assignment, but this time the app is supposed to exfiltrate the secret
via ultrasonic sound.

Submission

You are supposed to submit:

    The modified App in source code form as well as an APK
    A short description how you implemented the channel

Setting

After the lab sessions on June13th and 14th, we will install you app on
an Xiaomi A1 phone running the latest version of Android. We will then
enter a 4 digit pin number, and you are then supposed to recover that
pin number with either your laptop computer or your mobile phone from a
1-2 meter distance. Before the pin is entered, the phone will be put
into flight mode.


Implementation

I recommend implementing a covert channel usuing (ultrasonic) sound.
Should you however feel like using a different channel such as causing
electromagnetic radiation, then you are also free to implement this
other channel as long as it also works in flight mode! Very creative
solutions might be graded with more than 20 points here.


Grading

You will receive 15 bonus points when:

    You manage to recover that pin number within seconds to minutes
    And we do not hear anything
    And the app does not require any special permissions such as for example switching the WiFi/Bluetooth on an off.
