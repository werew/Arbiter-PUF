IoT #2 - active attacks against the smart plug

In this assignment, you are supposed to perform an active attack against an IoT device. 
We will analyse the smart plug that was shown in the lecture. It uses an encrypted connection to a cloud service.
 You are supposed to act as an man in the middle, decrypt that connection and provide the plaintext.
Setup

We will provide two (almost identical) access points with labels switch1/2 sniffing. 
You are supposed to configure your laptop computer as a gateway (using probably eduroam as your uplink network) 
and DHCP server and connect your laptop computer with an Ethernet cable to the blue networking port of the access point. 
Then you will analyse the traffic that is transmitted to the cloud, perform a man-in-the-middle attack and provide the 
plaintext of the connection.

The switches have labels switch1/2, and they are configured to connect to the respective access points. 
You may ask Erik to send commands to the respective switches from the mobile app.


Please state what is transmitted when...

    The switch connects to the cloud when it is powered on.
    When it is instructed to switch the power on.
    When it is instructed to switch the power off.
