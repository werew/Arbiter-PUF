IoT #1 - passive protocol analysis for the lightbulb


In your first assignment, you are supposed to analyse the network protocol of the smart light bulb that was shown in the lecture. 
You task is to describe what is sent from the cloud to the device to switch on the light and what is sent to switch off the light. 
Of course there are more features of the light (brightness, colours...), but you are not required to investigate that in the lecture.

Describe in text how the command from the cloud to the device that switches the light on and off looks like. Also say whether there 
is anything in the protocol that prevents attackers who control the network traffic to switch the light on or off.

###########  Setup #################

We will provide an access point. The device (the white box that acts as a bridge between WiFi and the light bulb) is 
configured to connect to a WiFi network named milight with psk twente2018. The access point is configured to provide that 
network and it will also provide an uplink through the eduroam network. Internally, the network is bridged to the internal bridge 
br-mighlight. The access point has a label with: Milight sniffing with eduroam

DO NOT CONNECT TO THE milight WIFI WITH YOUR COMPUTER, IT IS ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE USED BY THE MILIGHT BRIDGE!

The access point will also run a second network for you attached to the yellow Ethernet ports. When you connect to one of the
 yellow ports, you will receive an IPv4 address via DHCP. You can login to the access point with an ssh connection to 192.168.141.1
 with username root and password twente2018.

You can then run tcpdump like:

tcpdump -i br-milight -n

The internal space is limited, to do not write any files on the access point. For remote sniffing, you can do something like:

ssh root@192.168.141.1 "tcpdump -s0 -w - -i br-milight" | wireshark-gtk -k -i -

When your local wireshark binary is just wireshark, then do:

ssh root@192.168.141.1 "tcpdump -s0 -w - -i br-milight" | wireshark -k -i -

Do not change any other settings of the access point.

You may ask Erik to switch the device on and off (or to change colours).


############## Additional help ####################

We have published a capture of the traffic of the device. Here, it was alternately switched on and off every 10 seconds.
