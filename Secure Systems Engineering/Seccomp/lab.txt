Secure Systems Engineering #2 - Add seccomp rules


In the files section, you find a C implementation of the random cat webserver you already know from the last assignments.

Your task is to add seccomp rules to the process. In a nutshell, all syscalls that are not required by the server
 should be denied before the first byte of remote input is processed.
